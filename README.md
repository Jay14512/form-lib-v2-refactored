# Form Library (PHP OOP Practice)

A small PHP-based project created to practice **object-oriented programming**, **dynamic form generation**, and **basic form validation**.

Module: PHP  
Goal: Understanding OOP, inheritance & form validation  
Status: ✅ Completed  
Version: 1.0  
Tech: PHP 8+, Composer, Bootstrap 5

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a dynamic HTML form using **pure PHP**, without frameworks.

All form fields are defined in a configuration array and instantiated dynamically using object-oriented principles.  
Each form element is responsible for rendering itself, while validation logic is handled separately.

The project focuses on clean structure, reusability, and separation of concerns.

## ✨ Features

- Dynamic form generation via configuration array
- Object-oriented form elements
- Individual render logic per input type
- Separate validation logic
- Clean and readable code structure

---

## 🧱 Implemented Form Elements

- Input (base class)
- Textarea
- Select
- Checkbox
- Radiobutton
- Submit

Each element extends a base input class and implements its own `render()` method.

---

## ✅ Validation

Validation is handled by a dedicated `Validation` class.

Implemented checks:
- Required fields
- Email format validation
- Required checkbox validation
- Error collection in an array

Validation logic is fully separated from rendering logic.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Applying OOP concepts in PHP
- Working with inheritance and constructors
- Building dynamic forms from configuration data
- Separating logic, structure, and presentation
- Implementing basic validation without frameworks
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable PHP code

This project helped me better understand how backend logic can be structured in a scalable and reusable way.
